# Smoothie96 Beta 2

**Smoothie** is a theme entirely based on the concept of easy customization and a main SCSS file containing mixins for various UI components, to make the job of porting the theme relatively easy and fast.

**Smoothie96** is the Windows96 port of Smoothie, including fixes for the vast majority of apps available in the v3 beta.

**Smoothie and Smoothie96 have been and are still entirely designed, written and updated by [Driftini](https://driftini.github.io/)**.
